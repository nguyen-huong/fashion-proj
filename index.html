  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p> In recent years, the media spotlight has been solidly projected on the design business. Slow
fashion is a new development inside the design business that expects to lessen material waste and
ecological exhaustion while expanding moral treatment of laborers; the objective is to dial back
the worldwide creation and utilization process to shape an industry that will be more reasonable
over the long haul.</p>
  <p>
Alongside the improvement of something else socially and eco-cognizant creation and promoting
rehearses, there is still space for the slow fashion is the development to develop past its present
degree. The idea of "slow fashion" is generally new - albeit the possibility of supportability had been
around for quite a long time, and trend-setters initially ventured outside of the paradigm of
trending in the fashion industry and investigated potential outcomes past what had turned into the
standard for dress creation and utilization.
