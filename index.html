  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p> In recent years, the media spotlight has been solidly projected on the design business. Slow
fashion is a new development inside the design business that expects to lessen material waste and
ecological exhaustion while expanding moral treatment of laborers; the objective is to dial back
the worldwide creation and utilization process to shape an industry that will be more reasonable
over the long haul.</p>

  <h2>Story</h2>
     <p>
Arrow was launched with a mission statement that set the scene on combining ethics and long-lasting wearing.   
Whether that is on customizing, long-wearing, or eco-friendly – ultimately it’s about creating and designing beautiful garments with a thoughtful approach.
       Regeneration garments can be worn and shelved for seasons after season. </p>
       <p>Inspired by the items that have been in our wardrobes for years, we were determined on how we can improve shelf life. Our versatile pieces are made to the highest quality, prioriting your needs and fit over quantity. We are creating a movement, where quality and fit and style should go first.
