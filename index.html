  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p> In recent years, the media spotlight has been solidly projected on the design business. Slow
fashion is a new development inside the design business that expects to lessen material waste and
ecological exhaustion while expanding moral treatment of laborers; the objective is to dial back
the worldwide creation and utilization process to shape an industry that will be more reasonable
over the long haul.</p>
  <p>
Alongside the improvement of something else socially and eco-cognizant creation and promoting
rehearses, there is still space for the slow fashion is the development to develop past its present
degree. The idea of "slow fashion" is generally new - albeit the possibility of supportability had been
around for quite a long time, and trend-setters initially ventured outside of the paradigm of
trending in the fashion industry and investigated potential outcomes past what had turned into the
standard for dress creation and utilization.

  <h2>Story</h2>
     <p>
Regeneration was launched with a mission statement that set the scene “Ethical fashion should just look like fashion”.   
Whether you call it Eco, Ethical, Sustainable, Green, Slow, Conscious or Responsible – ultimately it’s about creating and designing beautiful garments with a thoughtful approach.
Regeneration garments can be worn and loved season after season. Good clothes do not go out of fashion. We are inspired by the items that have been in our wardrobes for years - because true style is timeless, not transient and throwaway. Our versatile day-to-evening pieces are made to the highest quality. They are designed to last and be loved.
We don't want to preach about ethics to our clients. We simply want to create the solution for them. People want fashionable clothes and they should be able to buy them without worrying about the impact on the world. We are creating an alternative - an ethical and sustainable choice that puts design and quality first. 
Regeneration is a result of several years of working in the conventional fashion world where the big brands would prioritise making money over all else. Is it possible to run a successful company and still have a heart? Yes, with determination and strong beliefs anything is possible.
It just takes one Regeneration to make a difference.
